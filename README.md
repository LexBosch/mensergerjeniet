# Mens erger je niet evolutionary algorythm

By Lex Bosch, Anton Ligterink en Cas van Rijbroek

## Description

In this project, we used a evolutionary algorythm to evaluate and mutate models in order to become the most optimal players of the board game "mensch Ã¤rgere dich nicht".

## Getting Started
In order to train your own model, you need to clone the repository and set the paramters at the end of population.py to your desired. Once completed, simply run population.py and watch the results.
